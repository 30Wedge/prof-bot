We also explore different techniques for understanding and designing for the individual who uses or engages with knowledge media. Techniques and tools are drawn from a range of design perspectives including traditional user centered design, participatory design, engineering, and industrial design. The appropriateness of each technique and tool for different design problems and settings is discussed and the course concludes with an examination of the development of new techniques and tools for new design challenges.

{"id": "AER503H1S20171", "code": "AER503H1S", "name": "Aeroelasticity", "description": "Static aeroelastic phenomena are studied, including divergence of slender wings and control reversal. Various methods of solution are considered such as closed form, matrix format iteration and the Rayleigh-Ritz approach. A Study of vibration and flutter of wings and control surfaces is presented with particular emphasis on those parameters which affect flutter speed.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Division of Engineering Science", "prerequisites": "AER307H1 and AER501H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 500, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2017 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 46800, "duration": 7200, "location": "GB 120"}, {"day": "MONDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "WB 144"}], "size": 30, "enrolment": 17}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 57600, "duration": 3600, "location": "WB 144"}], "size": 30, "enrolment": 17}]}

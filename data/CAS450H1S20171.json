CAS450H1 provides students with the opportunity to research questions of contemporary relevance stemming from Asia and its transnational networks and communities. Addressing a range of methodologies, including historical-archival, ethnographic, visual/media, and statistical/quantitative, the course emphasizes research experience outside the classroom, in Asia as well as locally with communities in Toronto. Students will develop their own research contributions while working collaboratively.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Asia Pacific Studies", "prerequisites": "At least 14 FCEs, including CAS200Y1/(CAS201H1, CAS202H1); CAS310H1; CAS400H1", "exclusions": "CAS400Y1", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2017 Winter", "breadths": [3], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["L Ong"], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 43200, "duration": 7200, "location": "LA 214"}], "size": 20, "enrolment": 20}]}

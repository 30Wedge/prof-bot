We analyze the role of metaphysics in medieval science, including determinism/indeterminism, plenism/vacuism, finitism/infinitism, theism/deism, and teleology/mechanism. Finally, we explicate the Aristotelian-medieval method, by focusing on the notions of demonstrative truth, intuition, and deduction.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Inst. for the History & Philosophy of Science & Technology", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2017 Winter", "breadths": [2], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["H Barseghyan"], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 57600, "duration": 7200, "location": "VC 215"}], "size": 86, "enrolment": 86}]}

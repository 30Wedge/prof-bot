The primary focus will be on biochemical kinetic models and the nonlinear dynamics that arise from them. An introduction to and survey of techniques in mathematics (especially nonlinear dynamics and stochastic processes) will be presented, along with an overview of numerical methods for computational simulation, including an introduction to molecular modelling.

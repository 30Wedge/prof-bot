{"id": "ECE510H1F20169", "code": "ECE510H1F", "name": "Introduction to Lighting Systems", "description": "An introduction to the physics of lighting systems (e.g. plasma physics, radiation spectrum, physics of light-emitting diodes) and the corresponding power electronic driver circuits (ballasts). The operating principles and the science behind different types of lamps are covered. These include incandescent, fluorescent, low and high pressure sodium, mercury, metal halide lamps and LED lighting systems. The designs and technical challenges of the electronic ballasts for each type of lighting source are discussed. Issues related to lighting regulations, layout, delivery, efficiency, control and the economic and environmental assessment of current lighting systems are briefly addressed.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Edward S.

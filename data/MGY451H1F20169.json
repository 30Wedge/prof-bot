We emphasize the use of genetic approaches to address problems in cell biology and development, such as the regulation of cell fate. Much of the knowledge gained from these simple organisms has proven broadly applicable, and the same principles of developmental genetic analysis underlie efforts to understand the development of more complex organisms.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Molecular Genetics", "prerequisites": "BIO260H1/HMB265H1, MGY311Y1/CSB349H1/BCH311H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2016 Fall", "breadths": [4], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["H Krause", "M Justice", "A Spence"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 57600, "duration": 3600, "location": "MS 4279"}, {"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 57600, "duration": 3600, "location": "MS 4279"}], "size": 50, "enrolment": 31}]}

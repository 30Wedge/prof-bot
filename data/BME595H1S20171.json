{"id": "BME595H1S20171", "code": "BME595H1S", "name": "Medical Imaging", "description": "This is a first course in medical imaging. It is designed as a final year course for engineers. It has a physical and mathematical approach emphasizing engineering concepts and design. It describes magnetic resonance and ultrasound and X ray imaging in detail. These topics allow engineers to apply principles learned in the first two years in: computer fundamentals, dynamics, calculus, basic EM theory, algebra and differential equations, signals systems. It is a depth course complementing the kernels: communication systems (modulation), fields and waves (wave propagation) and on probability and random processes (Poisson and Gaussian noise). It will introduce students to the concept of measurement as an \u201cinverse problem\u201d. The laboratory will involve hands on NMR and Ultrasound measurements as well as image analysis of MRI data.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Institute of Biomaterials & Biomedical Engineering", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 500, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2017 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "P0102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 54000, "duration": 10800, "location": "MB 78"}], "size": 20, "enrolment": 14}, {"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["H Cheng"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 61200, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 2135"}], "size": 40, "enrolment": 40}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": ["H Cheng"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 61200, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 2185"}], "size": 40, "enrolment": 35}, {"code": "P0101", "instructors": ["H Cheng"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 54000, "duration": 10800, "location": "MB 78"}], "size": 20, "enrolment": 17}]}

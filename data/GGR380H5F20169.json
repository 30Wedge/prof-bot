{"id": "GGR380H5F20169", "code": "GGR380H5F", "name": "Communicating with Maps", "description": "This course teaches and examines the principles of cartography and provides experience in producing and reading maps. While students will learn how to map using GIS software, the emphasis is on the principles and the ability to communicate via maps. The second half of the course explores the literature on cartology and cartographic positivism, delving into myth and meaning in maps, cognitive cartographic theory, cartographic ethics and map use and misuse in the mass media. The political and social discourse in maps is analyzed through cartographic criticism, through the application of graphic logic and design principles, and through an understanding of external and internal power relations in maps.

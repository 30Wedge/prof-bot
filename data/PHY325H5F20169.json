The topics include: vector calculus, linear algebra applied to coordinate transformations, probability distributions, systems of linear ordinary differential equations and boundary value problems, Fourier analysis and orthogonal functions, Laplace's, Bessel's and the Heat equations in various coordinate systems, and use of Legendre polynomials and Spherical Bessel functions. Computational methods and standard software tools will be used to solve the complex physics problems.

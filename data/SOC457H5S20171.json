We will examine why the link between race and biology is problematic and the scientific evidence for it; how can we think about race and ethnicity without assuming that people are naturally divided into groups; social processes of ethnic and racial classification and ethnic and racial boundaries; ethnic and racial inequality, and how it is reproduced and contested.

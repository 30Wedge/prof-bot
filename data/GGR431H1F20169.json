{"id": "GGR431H1F20169", "code": "GGR431H1F", "name": "Regional Dynamics", "description": "The space-economy has always been characterized by polarization across myriad metrics. As a result, regional economic change has been very difficult to fully explain (and certainly predict) using conventional (orthodox) theories and methods. This course examines the theoretical linkage between related trends in terms of globalization, vertical disintegration, specialization, innovation, and the locational behaviour of firms. We will focus on the seemingly counter-intuitive finding that regional economic change in a time of increasing global interdependence is increasingly dependent on the local context. Topics will include evolutionary economic geography, path dependence, economic clusters, learning regions, the role of institutions, knowledge spill-overs, and the geography of innovation, among others. We will see why the economic activity is becoming ever more concentrated in space even as it globalizes.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Geography and Planning", "prerequisites": "10.0 FCE's including GGR221H1 or GGR251H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2016 Fall", "breadths": [3], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["R DiFrancesco"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 50400, "duration": 7200, "location": "LM 123"}], "size": 30, "enrolment": 12}]}

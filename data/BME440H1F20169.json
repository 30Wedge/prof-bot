Since these technologies enable theinvestigation of a wide range of research questions with importantclinical implications, the main focus of the course is learning thesetechnologies while subsequent application within the lab will allowevidence-based investigation into specific research questions.Scientific literature (both good and bad) pertaining to each technologywill be reviewed as examples of conducting investigations.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Institute of Biomaterials & Biomedical Engineering", "prerequisites": "CHE353H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2016 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "P0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 61200, "duration": 14400, "location": "MB 325"}], "size": 24, "enrolment": 16}, {"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["H Cheng"], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 43200, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 1230"}], "size": 24, "enrolment": 16}]}

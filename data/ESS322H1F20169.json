Laboratory exercises familiarise students with the most common rock types, and provide practical examples of the theoretical principles discussed in lectures. This course also has a mandatory weekend field trip to view igneous and metamorphic rocks and structures in the Bancroft or Montreal area.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Earth Sciences", "prerequisites": "ESS222H1 & ESS211H1/ENV233H1", "exclusions": "GLG318H1,GLG319H1", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2016 Fall", "breadths": [5], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["Z Zajacz"], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 57600, "duration": 10800, "location": "ES 2101"}, {"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 39600, "duration": 7200, "location": "ES 2101"}], "size": 30, "enrolment": 25}]}

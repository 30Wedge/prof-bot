{"id": "GGR227H5F20169", "code": "GGR227H5F", "name": "Ecosystems and Environmental Change", "description": "This course introduces the rapidly advancing fields of ecosystem science through the exploration of how ecosystems respond to climate change, pollution, and intensive natural resource management. The impacts from anthropogenic stressors on ecosystem functioning are often complex, with interactions occurring among plants, microorganisms, and physical and chemical environments. Empirical and modelling approaches are explored as they allow us to understand and predict ecosystem functioning and the linkages and feedbacks with changing environments. Lecture topics and case studies focus primarily on important representative Canadian ecosystems that also play vital roles in the resource sector including forests, agricultural land, wetlands and aquatic ecosystems.

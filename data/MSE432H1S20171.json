{"id": "MSE432H1S20171", "code": "MSE432H1S", "name": "Macromolecular Materials Engineering", "description": "This broad overview course begins with an introduction to polymer synthesis, followed by discussion of molecular structure, microstructure and material macrostructure of polymers leading to an understanding of polymer properties and performance.\u00a0 The important processing operations which are used to convert raw polymers into finished products will be discussed and some quantified.\u00a0 Brief consideration will be given to product design/material selection issues and the environmental implicaitons of polymers. Several leading edge examples from the electronics, transportation and medical industries are introduced during the course.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Materials Science and Engineering", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "CHE461H1 and MSE330H1", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2017 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["H Naguib"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 43200, "duration": 10800, "location": "WB 119"}], "size": 50, "enrolment": 39}]}

{"id": "HIS202H1F20169", "code": "HIS202H1F", "name": "Gender, Race and Science", "description": "This course examines scientific ideas about human difference from the 18th-century to the present. It explores how scientists and their critics portrayed the nature of race, sex difference, and masculinity/femininity in light of debates over nation, citizenship, colonialism, emancipation, knowledge and equality. The course will also introduce students to the uses of gender and race as analytic categories within the practice of history. While the course draws much of its subject matter from the history of the United States, it also explores selective issues in European and colonial contexts.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "History", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 200, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2016 Fall", "breadths": [3], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["C Dale"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 61200, "duration": 7200, "location": "GI ---"}], "size": 170, "enrolment": 170}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 39600, "duration": 3600, "location": "UC 44"}], "size": 17, "enrolment": 17}, {"code": "T0102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 39600, "duration": 3600, "location": "UC 69"}], "size": 17, "enrolment": 15}, {"code": "T0201", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "UC 44"}], "size": 17, "enrolment": 16}, {"code": "T0202", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "UC 51"}], "size": 17, "enrolment": 14}, {"code": "T0301", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 46800, "duration": 3600, "location": "UC 44"}], "size": 17, "enrolment": 17}, {"code": "T0401", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "UC 44"}], "size": 17, "enrolment": 16}, {"code": "T0402", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "UC 51"}], "size": 17, "enrolment": 17}, {"code": "T5101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 61200, "end": 64800, "duration": 3600, "location": "UC 44"}], "size": 17, "enrolment": 16}, {"code": "T5201", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 64800, "end": 68400, "duration": 3600, "location": "UC 44"}], "size": 17, "enrolment": 17}, {"code": "T5301", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 68400, "end": 72000, "duration": 3600, "location": "UC 44"}], "size": 17, "enrolment": 17}]}

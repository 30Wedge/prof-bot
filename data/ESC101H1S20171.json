{"id": "ESC101H1S20171", "code": "ESC101H1S", "name": "Praxis I", "description": "Praxis I introduces students to the theory and practice of engineering design and communication. Through an integrated suite of interactive lectures, structured Design Studio activities, and multiple small-team projects, students explore core elements of these disciplines. Emphasis is placed on problem framing, divergent, convergent, and critical thinking, idea generation and selection, modelling and prototyping, efficient and effective teamwork, structuring design activities, constructing credible engineering arguments, and selected additional elements of engineering communication. Praxis I challenges students to explore the theories and principles that underpin engineering design and communication, to develop rigorous, individualized approaches to solving engineering problems, to adopt an outward looking and entrepreneurial engineering perspective, and to take an active role in shaping their future engineering studies.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Division of Engineering Science", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "APS111H1", "level": 100, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2017 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": []}

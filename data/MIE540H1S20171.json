{"id": "MIE540H1S20171", "code": "MIE540H1S", "name": "* Product Design", "description": "This course takes a 360\u00b0 perspective on product design: beginning at the market need, evolving this need into a concept, and optimizing the concept. Students will gain an understanding of the steps involved and the tools utilized in developing new products. The course will integrate both business and engineering concepts seamlessly through examples, case studies and a final project. Some of the business concepts covered include: identifying customer needs, project management and the economics of product design. The engineering design tools include: developing product specifications, concept generation, concept selection, FAST diagrams, orthogonal arrays, full and fractional factorials, noises, interactions, tolerance analysis and latitude studies. Specific emphasis will be placed on robust and tunable technology for product optimization and generating product families. Critical Parameters will be developed using the Voice of the Customer (VOC), FAST diagrams and a House of Quality (HOQ).", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Mechanical & Industrial Engineering", "prerequisites": "MIE231H1/MIE236H1 or equivalent.", "exclusions": "", "level": 500, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2017 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 61200, "end": 72000, "duration": 10800, "location": "MC 254"}], "size": 120, "enrolment": 104}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 72000, "end": 75600, "duration": 3600, "location": "MC 254"}], "size": 120, "enrolment": 97}]}

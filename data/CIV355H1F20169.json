Major topics include probabilistic modelling, queuing models of transport operations, network models, mathematical programming and simulation. The application of these methods to modeling various components of the urban transportation system (including road, transit and pedestrian facilities) and to the planning and design of logistically-oriented urban service systems (e.g., fire and police departments, emergency medical services, etc..) is emphasized.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Division of Engineering Science", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2016 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1220"}, {"day": "MONDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 50400, "duration": 7200, "location": "RS 208"}], "size": 20, "enrolment": 8}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": ["A Shalaby"], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 50400, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 1220"}], "size": 20, "enrolment": 8}]}

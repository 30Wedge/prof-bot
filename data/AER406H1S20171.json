{"id": "AER406H1S20171", "code": "AER406H1S", "name": "Aircraft Design", "description": "This course involves the detailed preliminary design of an airplane. Performance and mission specifications are given, as well as the engine\u2019s characteristics. The class is divided into teams of three to four students who are guided to develop an airplane that can meet these specifications. Individual team members will specialize in areas such as \u201cperformance\u201d, \u201cstructure\u201d, \u201csystems\u201d, etc., although all team members should be conversant with each other\u2019s results and methodology. Each week, a representative of each team presents a progress lecture on that team\u2019s efforts, which is discussed and critiqued by the class. Also, the teams meet one-on-one with the professor and tutors to discuss specific design questions. At the end of the course each team will present a verbal and written report of sufficient detail to provide a compelling case for the feasibility of their proposed airplane.

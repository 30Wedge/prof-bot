Integrates patterns with field and experimental studies to clarify evolutionary processes. Topics include: origins of species and their adaptations, historical biogeography, co-evolution, community evolution, radiations and extinctions, fossils and macroevolutionary patterns, and the role of evolutionary information in conservation and biodiversity initiatives. Tutorials emphasize methods used to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships and the sequence of character evolution.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Ecology and Evolutionary Biology", "prerequisites": "BIO220H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2016 Fall", "breadths": [4], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["D McLennan"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 39600, "duration": 7200, "location": "RW 110"}, {"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 36000, "duration": 3600, "location": "RW 110"}], "size": 156, "enrolment": 156}]}

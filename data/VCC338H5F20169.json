{"id": "VCC338H5F20169", "code": "VCC338H5F", "name": "Picturing the Suburbs", "description": "This course considers how images of suburbia circulate between two interrelated but often counter-posed realms of visual culture: the popular genres of film, television, and new media entertainment and the iconography of \"high\" art practices such as painting, photography, and avant-garde film.

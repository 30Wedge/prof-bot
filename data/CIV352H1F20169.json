{"id": "CIV352H1F20169", "code": "CIV352H1F", "name": "Structural Design 1", "description": "The course covers the analysis of determinate and indeterminate structures, with application of the principles to the design of steel bridges. The nature of loads and structural safety is considered, with reference to the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code. Shear and bending moment diagrams for beams and frames are reviewed, as is the deflection of beams (by various methods) and the deflection of trusses. Classical bridge types, such as arches, trusses and suspension bridges are analyzed. Analysis tools studied include: Influence Lines, virtual work, fatigue, displacement methods for the analysis of indeterminate structures (including moment distribution for continuous beams), plus solution by computer frame analysis programs. The behaviour and design of basic steel members covers: tension members, compression members, beams, beam-columns and simple connections. Plastic analysis is introduced and applied to continuous beams. The expertise gained in structural analysis and steel design is then applied in a steel bridge design project.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Division of Engineering Science", "prerequisites": "CIV102H1 or equivalent.", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2016 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["E Bentz"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1220"}, {"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1220"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 46800, "duration": 3600, "location": "GB 303"}], "size": 20, "enrolment": 8}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 43200, "duration": 7200, "location": "GB 303"}], "size": 20, "enrolment": 8}]}

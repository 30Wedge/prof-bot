Use of Laplace transform to solve ordinary differential equations. Conversion of models from state variable form to transfer function representation and vice versa. Block diagrams and their manipulation. Time response: transient analysis and performance measures. Properties of feedback control systems. Steady state tracking: the notion of system type. The concept of stability of feedback systems, Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion. Frequency response and stability in the frequency domain. Root locus. Bode and Nyquist plots and their use in feedback control design.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Edward S.

{"id": "ESC102H1S20171", "code": "ESC102H1S", "name": "Praxis II", "description": "Praxis II follows from Praxis I and challenges students to apply, enhance, and refine their engineering design and communication skills. The design projects in Praxis II are both identified and defined by the students themselves, and focus on issues associated with the City of Toronto, its agencies and services, and its communities and citizens. In the first half of the course students, working in small teams, identify, frame, and document appropriate engineering challenges; in the second half they design, prototype, and present engineering solutions to a subset of those identified challenges. In support of these activities students continue to explore in greater depth the theories, tools, and practices of engineering design and communication. Praxis II culminates in an open showcase where students present their design solutions to representatives from interested governmental and non-governmental agencies, to their project stakeholders, and to the general public.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Division of Engineering Science", "prerequisites": "ESC101H1", "exclusions": "APS112H1", "level": 100, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2017 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "T0104", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 46800, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 3116"}], "size": 32, "enrolment": 27}, {"code": "T0105", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 46800, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 2165"}], "size": 32, "enrolment": 18}, {"code": "T0106", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 46800, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 2175"}], "size": 32, "enrolment": 22}, {"code": "T0107", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 46800, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 2185"}], "size": 32, "enrolment": 24}, {"code": "T0108", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 64800, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 2159"}], "size": 32, "enrolment": 21}, {"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["J Foster", "R Irish"], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 61200, "end": 64800, "duration": 3600, "location": "MC 102"}, {"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "MC 102"}, {"day": "MONDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "MC 102"}], "size": 397, "enrolment": 248}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 61200, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 2159"}], "size": 32, "enrolment": 26}, {"code": "T0102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 61200, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 3008"}], "size": 32, "enrolment": 28}, {"code": "T0103", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 61200, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 3012"}], "size": 32, "enrolment": 27}, {"code": "T0109", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 64800, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 3008"}], "size": 32, "enrolment": 27}, {"code": "T0110", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 64800, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 3012"}], "size": 32, "enrolment": 28}]}

The topic is to be mutually agreed upon by the student and supervisor. They must arrange the time, place, and provision of any materials and submit to the Undergraduate Office a signed form of agreement outlining details prior to being enrolled.\u00a0 In the Fall/Winter session, a commitment of 8-10 hours per week is expected for research and related course activities.\u00a0 In the Summer session, the number of hours doubles (16-20 per week) as the length of the term is halved.\u00a0 This course is normally open only to fourth year students with adequate background in Cell and Systems Biology. Course requirements include a final report and either an oral presentation (Summer session) or a poster presentation (Fall/Winter session).\u00a0 Monthly workshops are scheduled and highly recommended.\u00a0 Details for enrollment are available at http://csb.utoronto.ca/undergraduate-studies/undergraduate-courses/undergraduate-course-level-400/.

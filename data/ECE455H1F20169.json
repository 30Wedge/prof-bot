Illustrative applications are drawn from audio and biomedical signal processing, communication systems, and image and video signal processing.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Division of Engineering Science", "prerequisites": "ECE355H1", "exclusions": "ECE362H1, ECE431H1", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2016 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["H Cheng"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 57600, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1230"}, {"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 61200, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 1230"}], "size": 30, "enrolment": 20}, {"code": "P0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 64800, "duration": 10800, "location": "SF 2201"}], "size": 15, "enrolment": 12}, {"code": "P0102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 64800, "duration": 10800, "location": "SF 2201"}], "size": 15, "enrolment": 8}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "RS 310"}], "size": 30, "enrolment": 20}]}

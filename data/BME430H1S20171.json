{"id": "BME430H1S20171", "code": "BME430H1S", "name": "Human Whole Body Biomechanics", "description": "An introduction to the principles of human body movement. Specific topics include the dynamics of human motion and the neural motor system, with a focus on the positive/negative adaptability of the motor system. Students will experience basic techniques of capturing and analyzing human motion. Engineering applications and the field of rehabilitation engineering will be emphasized using other experimental materials. This course is designed for senior undergraduate and graduate students.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Cross Disciplinary Programs Office", "prerequisites": "CHE353H1 or BME205H1 or MIE100H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2017 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "RS 310"}, {"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 54000, "duration": 7200, "location": "RS 310"}], "size": 25, "enrolment": 4}, {"code": "P0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 57600, "duration": 7200, "location": "MB 78"}], "size": 25, "enrolment": 4}]}

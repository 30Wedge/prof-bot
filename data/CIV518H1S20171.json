Ultimate strength, stability, and postbuckling are emphasized in topical examples including: plate girders, composite steel/concrete girders, second-order frame behaviour, high-strength bolted and welded framing connections. Design applications considering metal fatigue and brittle fracture, and methods of plastic analysis are also introduced. Canadian design standards and the Limit States Design concepts are used.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Civil Engineering", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 500, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2017 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "RS 208"}, {"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 43200, "duration": 7200, "location": "WB 130"}], "size": 60, "enrolment": 44}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 61200, "duration": 7200, "location": "RS 208"}], "size": 60, "enrolment": 44}]}

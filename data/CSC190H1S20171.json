Students will learn to use the C programming language to\u00a0design and implement computational solutions to problems drawn from their 1S courses, and will explore new programming paradigms, algorithm design\u00a0techniques, and data structures\u00a0appropriate to these challenges. Specifically, this course aims to have students work with and\u00a0understand linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, hashing, pointers (including function pointers) and arrays, data types and bit operations, and dynamic memory management.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Division of Engineering Science", "prerequisites": "CSC180H1", "exclusions": "APS106H1, CSC192H1, ECE244H1 or MIE250H1", "level": 100, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2017 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 57600, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1130"}, {"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1130"}, {"day": "MONDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "SF 1105"}], "size": 160, "enrolment": 126}, {"code": "L0102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 46800, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1130"}, {"day": "MONDAY", "start": 61200, "end": 64800, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1130"}, {"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1130"}], "size": 160, "enrolment": 122}, {"code": "P0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 68400, "duration": 10800, "location": "SF 1013"}, {"day": "MONDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 68400, "duration": 10800, "location": "SF 1012"}], "size": 160, "enrolment": 126}, {"code": "P0102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 64800, "duration": 10800, "location": "SF 1013"}, {"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 64800, "duration": 10800, "location": "SF 1012"}], "size": 160, "enrolment": 122}]}

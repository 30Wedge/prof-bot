Landscape measures such as dominance, contagion, shape, patch/edge measures, connectivity will be considered in relation to land use/land cover change and distribution of selected species. The juxtaposition of cover types will be analyzed and changes in landscapes related to selected species. Various research methods are discussed and work is done using, geographic information systems to analyze landscapes in conjunction with bird and mammal count data.

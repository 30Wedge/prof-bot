{"id": "CHM217H1F20169", "code": "CHM217H1F", "name": "Introduction to Analytical Chemistry", "description": "Introduction to the science of chemical measurement, from sampling through analysis to the interpretation of results, including how water, food products, pharmaceuticals, and dietary supplements are analysed for content, quality, and potential contaminants. Also how to interpret experimental measurements, compare results and procedures, and calibrate analytical instrumentation. Through closely integrated lectures, laboratories, and tutorials, this highly practical course introduces a variety of analytical techniques including volumetric methods, potentiometry, uv/visible and infrared spectrophotometry, flame atomic absorption spectrometry, and chromatography.

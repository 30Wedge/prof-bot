{"id": "CHE475H1S20171", "code": "CHE475H1S", "name": "Biocomposites: Mechanics and Bioinspiration", "description": "An overview on structure, processing and application of natural and biological materials, biomaterials for biomedical applications, and fibre-reinforced eco-composites based on renewable resources will be provided. Fundamental principles related to linear elasticity, linear viscoelasticity, dynamic mechanical response, composite reinforcement mechanics, and time-temperature correspondence will be introduced. Novel concepts in comparative biomechanics, biomimetic and bio-inspired material design, and materials\u2019 ecological and environmental impact will be discussed. In addition, key material processing methods and testing and characterization techniques will be presented. Structure-property relationships for materials broadly ranging from natural materials, including wood, bone, cell, and soft tissue, to synthetic composite materials for industrial and biomedical applications will be covered.\r\nNot Offered in 2015-16.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2017 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 43200, "duration": 10800, "location": "BA 2135"}], "size": 38, "enrolment": 20}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 39600, "duration": 3600, "location": "WB 144"}], "size": 38, "enrolment": 20}]}

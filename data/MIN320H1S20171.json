{"id": "MIN320H1S20171", "code": "MIN320H1S", "name": "Explosives and Fragmentation in Mining", "description": "Efficient drilling and blasting is important to successful mining in rock formations. This course studies the planning, design, and economics of rock blasting for a full range of surface and underground, mining and construction projects. Emphasis will be on optimization of fragmentation using blast geometry and those variables available to the field engineer. This course covers the selection of modern industrial explosives, their history, physical properties, and safe handling, including an introduction to the theory of detonation, and rock response. Safety procedures in storage and transportation will be studied along with the monitoring and control of blast side effects. A field trip is associated with this course.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Civil Engineering", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2017 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["J Harrison"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 46800, "duration": 3600, "location": "GB 119"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 39600, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 1240"}], "size": 40, "enrolment": 21}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "GB 119"}], "size": 40, "enrolment": 21}]}

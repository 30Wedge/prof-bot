{"id": "CHE113H1S20171", "code": "CHE113H1S", "name": "Concepts in Chemical Engineering", "description": "This course provides first year students with an overview of the chemical industry, the chemical engineering profession, and introduces key concepts for the upcoming years of study.\u00a0 The chemical industry is the interface between natural resources (minerals, oil, gas, agricultural products, etc.) and the consumers of the higher value products derived therefrom.\u00a0 This diverse industry has both high volume-low unit value and low volume-high unit value products, and the manufacture of each type of product has its own challenges.\u00a0 The chemical engineering profession applies the scientific fundamentals through two key concepts: Unit Operations as well as Flux.\u00a0 The fundamental elements of stoichiometry and reaction kinetics are further extended to cover the concepts of yield, conversion and their specific applications to continuous and batch reactor systems.\u00a0 Analysis of electrical circuits is introduced, leading to nodal analysis of circuits. The application of resistance in series and capacitance is extended into chemical engineering problems involved, heat transfer, mass transfer and momentum transfer, as well as reaction engineering.\u00a0 The laboratory will reinforce these key chemical engineering principles.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Engineering First Year Office", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 100, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2017 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 39600, "duration": 7200, "location": "WB 342"}], "size": 64, "enrolment": 55}, {"code": "T0102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 39600, "duration": 7200, "location": "WB 342"}], "size": 71, "enrolment": 60}, {"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["G Norval"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 61200, "end": 64800, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1190"}, {"day": "MONDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 61200, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1190"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 61200, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1190"}], "size": 135, "enrolment": 115}, {"code": "P0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 43200, "duration": 10800, "location": "WB 25"}], "size": 55, "enrolment": 45}, {"code": "P0102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 43200, "duration": 10800, "location": "WB 25"}], "size": 50, "enrolment": 40}, {"code": "P0103", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 43200, "duration": 10800, "location": "WB 25"}], "size": 40, "enrolment": 30}]}

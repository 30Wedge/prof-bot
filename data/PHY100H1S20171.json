{"id": "PHY100H1S20171", "code": "PHY100H1S", "name": "The Magic of Physics", "description": "This course provides a survey of Physics, including both Classical and Modern Physics. It is designed for non-scientists, and assumes no background in either science or mathematics. The approach to the course is broad rather than deep. We will concentrate on the concepts underlying such fascinating topics as planetary motion, chaos, the nature of light, time travel, black holes, matter waves, Schrodinger's cat, quarks, and climate change. We will uncover the wonders of the classical and the quantum worlds courtesy of Galileo, Newton, Maxwell, Einstein, Heisenberg and many others.\r\n(PHY100H1 is primarily intended as a Breadth Requirement course for students in the Humanities and Social Science)", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Physics", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "PHY131H1/PHY132H1/PHY151H1/PHY152H1 taken previously or concurrently", "level": 100, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2017 Winter", "breadths": [5], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "T0301", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 61200, "duration": 3600, "location": "MP 134"}], "size": 65, "enrolment": 65}, {"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["V Deyirmenjian"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 57600, "duration": 3600, "location": "MP 203"}, {"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 57600, "duration": 3600, "location": "MP 203"}], "size": 196, "enrolment": 196}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 61200, "duration": 3600, "location": "MP 134"}], "size": 66, "enrolment": 66}, {"code": "T0201", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 61200, "duration": 3600, "location": "SS 1070"}], "size": 65, "enrolment": 47}]}

{"id": "MIE414H1F20169", "code": "MIE414H1F", "name": "* Applied Fluid Mechanics", "description": "This course builds upon the material introduced in Fluid Mechanics I and connects it to a wide range of modern technical applications of fluid flow. Applications include the design of pipe and microfluidic networks, transient flow phenomena, compressible flow and shocks, characteristics of pumps, open channel flow and an overview of flow measurement techniques. Lectures are complemented by laboratory experiments on topics such as centrifugal pumps, flow transients and fluid flow in microfluidic chips.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Mechanical & Industrial Engineering", "prerequisites": "MIE312H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2016 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["A Guenther"], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 50400, "duration": 7200, "location": "WB 119"}, {"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1230"}], "size": 48, "enrolment": 30}, {"code": "P0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 64800, "duration": 10800, "location": "MC 215"}], "size": 48, "enrolment": 30}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 64800, "end": 68400, "duration": 3600, "location": "WB 144"}], "size": 48, "enrolment": 29}]}

{"id": "ECE259H1S20171", "code": "ECE259H1S", "name": "Electromagnetism", "description": "The fundamental laws of electromagnetics are covered; including Coulomb's law, Gauss' law, Poisson's and Laplace's equations, the Biot-Savart\u2019s law, Ampere's law, Faraday's law, and Maxwell's equations. Vector calculus is applied to determine the relationship between the electric and magnetic fields and their sources (charges and currents). Field-matter interaction is studied, including polarization in dielectric materials and magnetization in magnetic materials. Circuit elements such as the resistor, capacitor and inductor are introduced from an electromagnetic point of view. Other topics include: electric and magnetic forces, the electric potential, capacitance and inductance, electric and magnetic energy, magnetic circuits, boundary-value problems and transmission-lines.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Division of Engineering Science", "prerequisites": "ECE159H1 and AER210H1", "exclusions": "MAT291H1 or ECE221", "level": 200, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2017 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "T0103", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 3008"}], "size": 30, "enrolment": 29}, {"code": "T0104", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 3012"}], "size": 30, "enrolment": 30}, {"code": "T0105", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 57600, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 2159"}], "size": 46, "enrolment": 32}, {"code": "T0106", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 57600, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 3008"}], "size": 28, "enrolment": 28}, {"code": "T0107", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 57600, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 3012"}], "size": 28, "enrolment": 28}, {"code": "T0108", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 57600, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 3116"}], "size": 43, "enrolment": 30}, {"code": "L0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "MC 252"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 57600, "duration": 3600, "location": "SF 1101"}, {"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 46800, "duration": 3600, "location": "MC 252"}], "size": 120, "enrolment": 118}, {"code": "L0102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 36000, "duration": 3600, "location": "MC 252"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1170"}, {"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 46800, "duration": 3600, "location": "MC 252"}], "size": 143, "enrolment": 119}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "WB 144"}], "size": 30, "enrolment": 30}, {"code": "T0102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 2159"}], "size": 30, "enrolment": 30}]}

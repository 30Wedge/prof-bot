{"id": "ECE448H1F20169", "code": "ECE448H1F", "name": "Biocomputation", "description": "New technologies in molecular and cellular biology have allowed the collection of unprecedented amounts of biological data ranging from sequences to protein structures to gene expression. The need to synthesize knowledge from this abundant data is driving the convergence of the biological and computer sciences. This course will introduce the fundamental concepts and challenges in molecular biology and the computational and statistical approaches applied to model and address them. Course topics include basic concepts in molecular and structural biology, sequence-based algorithms (such as pairwise and multiple sequence alignment, statistical models), structure-based algorithms (such as energy models, homology modeling, threading), and systems biology algorithms (such as hierarchal and neural network clustering).", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Edward S.

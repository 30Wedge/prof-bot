Loadings due to force, support displacement, temperature change and member prestrain are covered. Timber design aspects include material properties, beams, compression members and simple connections.\u00a0 The behaviour and design of basic reinforced concrete elements covers concrete properties and members under axial load, shear and bending. Other practical aspects of design incorporated are crack control, minimum and maximum reinforcement ratios, durability, formwork and shoring.\u00a0 The aptitude for structural analysis and concrete design is then tested in a low-rise, reinforced concrete building design project.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Division of Engineering Science", "prerequisites": "CIV352H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2017 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 43200, "duration": 10800, "location": "WB 144"}], "size": 20, "enrolment": 7}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 39600, "duration": 7200, "location": "GB 248"}], "size": 20, "enrolment": 7}]}

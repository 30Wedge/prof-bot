{"id": "CHE341H1F20169", "code": "CHE341H1F", "name": "Engineering Materials", "description": "This course advances the understanding of the use of materials in engineering design, with special emphasis on corrosion and the effect of chemical environment on long term failure modes. Students will learn how to apply material property data to specify materials for load bearing applications, thermal and other non-structural applications, and chemical containment and transport. Topics will include strength of materials concepts, an introduction to computerized materials databases, material failure modes and criteria, principles of corrosion, and practical applications of corrosion prediction and mitigation. Students are required to design a component of their choice and do a detailed materials selection as a major design project.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2016 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["R Newman"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 43200, "duration": 7200, "location": "WB 219"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "WB 219"}], "size": 50, "enrolment": 22}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 36000, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 3008"}], "size": 25, "enrolment": 13}, {"code": "T0102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 46800, "duration": 3600, "location": "WB 144"}], "size": 25, "enrolment": 7}]}

Analysis of the results will help to develop skills in data analysis. Valuable not only for advanced work in microbiology but also in related fields that make use of bacteria and viruses as research tools. Topics include molecular techniques for identification and characterization of bacteria and viruses, biofilms, antibiotic resistance, site-directed mutagenesis, communication of bacteria with each other and their environment, propagation and assay of viruses, host response to infection, viral vectors.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Molecular Genetics", "prerequisites": "BIO120H1, BIO230H1, BIO260H1/HMB265H1", "exclusions": "MGY376H1", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2016 Fall", "breadths": [4], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["M Brown", "A Bognar"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "MS 4279"}], "size": 48, "enrolment": 33}, {"code": "P0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 43200, "duration": 10800, "location": "MS 3381"}], "size": 24, "enrolment": 22}, {"code": "P0201", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 43200, "duration": 10800, "location": "MS 3282"}], "size": 24, "enrolment": 10}]}

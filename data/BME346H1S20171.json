{"id": "BME346H1S20171", "code": "BME346H1S", "name": "Biomedical Engineering and Omics Technologies", "description": "An introduction to the principles and design of fundamental technologies used in biomedical engineering and \u201comics\u201d research. Topics may include but are not limited to tissue culture; spectroscopy; electrophoresis; PCR, genomics, sequencing technologies, and gene expression measurement; protein expression assays and tagging strategies; fluorescence labeling tools, microscopy, and high content imaging; DNA manipulation and transfection, RNAi, and other genetic and molecular tools for transformation of organisms. Laboratories will provide hands-on experience with selected technologies. Students will engage in a major design project in which they will design an experimental plan to investigate a specific research question, also of their design, utilizing available laboratory technologies.

This course uses a systems approach to analyzing anthropogenic material flow and other components of urban metabolism, linking them to the design of urban infrastructure. Elements of sustainable transportation, green buildings, urban climatology, urban vegetation, water systems and local energy supply are integrated in the design of sustainable urban neighbourhoods.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Civil Engineering", "prerequisites": "CIV340H1, [CIV375H1/CIV575H1], CIV531H1.", "exclusions": "", "level": 500, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2017 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 46800, "duration": 3600, "location": "SF 3201"}, {"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "SF 3201"}, {"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "SF 3201"}], "size": 50, "enrolment": 47}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 46800, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 2165"}], "size": 50, "enrolment": 35}]}

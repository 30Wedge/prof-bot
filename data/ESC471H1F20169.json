{"id": "ESC471H1F20169", "code": "ESC471H1F", "name": "Engineering Science Capstone Design", "description": "A half-year capstone design course in which students work in small teams to apply the engineering design, technical, and communication skills learned previously, while refining their skills in teamwork and project management. The course focus is the (re)design and implementation of experiments suitable for the undergraduate classroom or laboratory. Students identify, frame, and design solutions to problems that align with that focus, and the resulting designs are assessed on their engineering quality and design credibility. In addition, each student engages in individual critical reflection on their course activities, team performance, and on their growth as an engineering designer across their undergraduate program. Students are supported by a teaching team comprising both design and domain experts.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Division of Engineering Science", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "APS490Y1", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2016 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "P0101", "instructors": ["J Foster", "J Nogami"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 64800, "duration": 7200, "location": "SF 3201"}], "size": 15, "enrolment": 10}]}

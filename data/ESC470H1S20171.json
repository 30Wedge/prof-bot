{"id": "ESC470H1S20171", "code": "ESC470H1S", "name": "Energy Systems Capstone Design", "description": "A half-year capstone design course in which students work in teams to apply the engineering design, technical, and communication skills learned previously, while refining their skills in teamwork and project management. The course focus is on context-appropriate energy systems design and simulation, incorporating generation, transmission and storage of energy from across a range of traditional and alternative energy sources. Students identify, frame, and design solutions to problems that align with that focus, and the resulting designs are assessed on their engineering quality and design credibility. In addition, each student engages in individual critical reflection on their course activities, team performance, and on their growth as an engineering designer across their undergraduate program. Students are supported by a teaching team comprising both design and domain experts.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Division of Engineering Science", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "APS490Y1", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2017 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "P0101", "instructors": ["J Foster"], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 68400, "end": 75600, "duration": 7200, "location": "SF 3201"}], "size": 45, "enrolment": 25}]}

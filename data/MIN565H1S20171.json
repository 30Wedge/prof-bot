{"id": "MIN565H1S20171", "code": "MIN565H1S", "name": "Design and Support of Underground Mine Excavations", "description": "Geomechanical issues concerning the design of underground openings in hard rock are covered in the course: ground support [i.e. rock mass reinforcement] design, the dimensioning and sequencing of underground excavations and rock pillar design in hard rock applications. A review of modern concepts concerning rock and rock mass failure modes with application to support design is given. Both static and dynamic [rockburst] support design issues are addresses. Lastly instrumentation and monitoring techniques and backfill design and behaviour are also covered. Design issues are illustrated through the use of numerous field case studies .", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Civil Engineering", "prerequisites": "MIN429H1/CIV529H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 500, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2017 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["I Hadjigeorgiou"], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 46800, "duration": 3600, "location": "GB 221"}, {"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 50400, "duration": 7200, "location": "GB 244"}], "size": 50, "enrolment": 27}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": ["I Hadjigeorgiou"], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "GB 221"}], "size": 50, "enrolment": 26}]}

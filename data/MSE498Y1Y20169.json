{"id": "MSE498Y1Y20169", "code": "MSE498Y1Y", "name": "Design and Research Project", "description": "The students, alone or preferably organized in small groups, select a project involving original research and design work which is normally closely related to the current work of a staff member, and in close collaboration with an external partner (e.g. local industry, hospital, government lab). The students conceive and carry out a research plan under the supervision of the academic staff member usually with an external liaison person as a resource person. The project must contain a significant design component. The project work may be carried out in the department, at the external site, or both locations. The final grade will be based on interim and final written reports, oral presentations at the end of each term and a final poster presentation.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Materials Science and Engineering", "prerequisites": "permission of the Department", "exclusions": "CHM499Y1", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2016 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "P0101", "instructors": ["G Hibbard"], "times": [], "size": 65, "enrolment": 42}]}

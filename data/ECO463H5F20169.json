{"id": "ECO463H5F20169", "code": "ECO463H5F", "name": "Financial Market Microstructure", "description": "Traditional asset pricing theory focuses primarily on macro-level financial market prices in which the mysterious Walrasian Auctioneer sets prices that equilibrate demand and supply. In reality, security prices evolve through a large number of small-scale bilateral trades, performed by people that have specific, well-regulated and institutionalized roles. This course studies the impact of the trading institutions (e.g. market-makers, investment dealers) on security prices. In the process, it provides insights on the strategic trading behaviour of individual market participants and its relation to market anomalies such as speculative bubbles. Also, the course studies how micro-level irrationality affects such anomalies and when irrational behaviour does not ruin but instead enriches the gambler. This course uses mathematical models and is primarily theoretical, but it applies some of the theories in hands-on exercises.", "division": "University of Toronto Mississauga", "department": "Economics", "prerequisites": "ECO200Y5/204Y5/206Y5,202Y5/208Y5/209Y5,220Y5/227Y5/ STA(250H1,257H5/256H5)/STA(257H5/256H5,261H5/260H5)/STA(257H5/256H5,248H5/258H5)", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTM", "term": "2016 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": []}

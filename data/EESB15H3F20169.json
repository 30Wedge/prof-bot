The changing dynamics of convection deep within the Earth's mantle and associated super-continent assembly and breakup along with meteorite impacts, are now recognized as the major controls on development of the planet's atmosphere, oceans, biology, climate and geo-chemical cycles. This course reviews this long history and the methods and techniques used by geologists to identify ancient environments.", "division": "University of Toronto Scarborough", "department": "Dept. of Physical & Environmental Sci (UTSC)", "prerequisites": "EESA01H3 and EESA06H3", "exclusions": "", "level": 200, "campus": "UTSC", "term": "2016 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L01", "instructors": ["H Daxberger"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 61200, "duration": 7200, "location": "IC 220"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 28800, "end": 36000, "duration": 7200, "location": "IC 220"}], "size": 105, "enrolment": 100}, {"code": "L60", "instructors": [], "times": [], "size": 9999, "enrolment": 9}]}

The course will also analyze the formation of different regional traditions. The historical, cultural and linguistic culinary traditions will be illustrated by a series of pertinent literature on the topic. Special attention will be dedicated to the relationship that existed between the various cultures who controlled the country (pre Resurgence) and the traditions and recipes left in their wake (post Unification). In addition, the course will examine the effects that Italian immigration had in North America, especially on the Canadian and American culinary experience. Students will also have the opportunity to investigate and explore their own regional (Italian or otherwise) culinary history.

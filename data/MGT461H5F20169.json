{"id": "MGT461H5F20169", "code": "MGT461H5F", "name": "Negotiation", "description": "We negotiate every day - with potential employers, coworkers, roommates, landlords, parents, bosses, merchants, service providers, and even our friends and romantic partners. Negotiation is the art and science of securing agreements between two or more interdependent parties. It is a craft that must hold cooperation and competition in creative tension. It can be very difficult to do well. Even the most experienced negotiators often fall prey to common biases and errors in judgment. This course is highly experiential - students will practice, reflect, analyze, and practice again - and draws its insights from research in the cognitive, behavioral and social sciences.

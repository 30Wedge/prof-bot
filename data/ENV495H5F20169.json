{"id": "ENV495H5F20169", "code": "ENV495H5F", "name": "Restoration Ecology I", "description": "Restoration ecology is an emerging cross-disciplinary field of study that concerns human activities undertaken to promote the recovery, health, integrity and sustainability of degraded ecosystems. This course introduces the fundamental concepts of ecological restoration, addressing topics such as assessing ecosystem health, resilience, resistance and stability; community structure and biodiversity; invasive species; ecosystem processes and functions; societal aspects of ecological restoration (e.g., the relationship between social, economic and environmental sustainability). Many types of ecosystems (marine, freshwater, terrestrial, tropical and temperate) will be studied, largely through case-study investigations. Occasional field exercises on campus will be scheduled during regular class meeting times.

We will focus on how disability has served as a basis of exclusion from social, political, and economic institutions, and the ways in which actors have sought to undermine this system of discrimination. We will investigate a variety of themes including policy and judicial transformations, the evolution of the disability rights movement, the role of disability non-profit groups, and collective identity.

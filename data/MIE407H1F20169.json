{"id": "MIE407H1F20169", "code": "MIE407H1F", "name": "Nuclear Reactor Theory and Design", "description": "This course covers the basic principles of the neutronic design and analysis of nuclear fission reactors with a focus on Generation IV nuclear systems. Topics include radioactivity, neutron interactions with matter, neutron diffusion and moderation, the fission chain reaction, the critical reactor equation, reactivity effects and reactor kinetics. Multigroup neutron diffusion calculations are demonstrated using fast-spectrum reactor designs.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Mechanical & Industrial Engineering", "prerequisites": "MIE230H1 or equivalent", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2016 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["J Lebenhaft"], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 64800, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 1230"}, {"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 57600, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1230"}], "size": 20, "enrolment": 7}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": ["J Lebenhaft"], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 61200, "duration": 7200, "location": "WB 219"}], "size": 20, "enrolment": 7}]}

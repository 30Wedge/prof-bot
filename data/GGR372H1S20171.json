The course will focus on organizing health data in a GIS, clustering detection methods, and basic spatial statistics. Other topics like agent-based models and visualization techniques will be touched upon. Lab work will provide hands on experience with example data, leaving students with a firm grasp of contemporary health and medical problems and a skill set of spatial analytical methods that can be used to solve them.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Geography and Planning", "prerequisites": "8.0 FCEs", "exclusions": "GGR300H1(2015-2016), GGR335H5", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2017 Winter", "breadths": [3], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "P0201", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "SS 620"}], "size": 30, "enrolment": 19}, {"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["M Widener"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 43200, "duration": 7200, "location": "SS 2125"}], "size": 60, "enrolment": 44}, {"code": "P0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 46800, "duration": 3600, "location": "SS 620"}], "size": 30, "enrolment": 20}]}

The selection and processing of these materials to satisfy biocompatibility and functional requirements for applications in selected areas will be presented. Materials used for forming scaffolds for tissue engineering, and strategies for repair, regeneration and augmentation of degenerated or traumatized tissues will be reviewed with a focus on biocompatibility issues and required functionality for the intended applications.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Materials Science and Engineering", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2016 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["B Hatton"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 43200, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 1240"}, {"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1240"}], "size": 30, "enrolment": 30}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": ["B Hatton"], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 61200, "end": 64800, "duration": 3600, "location": "WB 144"}], "size": 30, "enrolment": 27}]}

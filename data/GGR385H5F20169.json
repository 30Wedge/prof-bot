{"id": "GGR385H5F20169", "code": "GGR385H5F", "name": "Geographies of Indigenous Identity and Well-Being", "description": "The geographies of indigenous identity are tied to political, social, economic, and environmental systems that shape the spaces in which we live. These geographies function at multiple scales - from international solidarity networks to nationalist claims on territory to an individual's sense of belonging. This course uses an intersectional approach that foregrounds how indigenous identity is tied to other aspects of identity such as gender, sexuality, race, and class and how identity intersects with well-being. While we will be focusing on indigenous identity within the context of Canada as a settler nation, we will also engage with how indigenous identities shape and are shaped by naturalisms in other parts of the world.

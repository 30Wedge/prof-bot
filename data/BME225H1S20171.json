Topics that will be covered include statistical distributions, the central limit theorem, linear functions of random variables and error propagation, statistical inference, analysis of variance, empirical model building (multiple regression) and design of experiments (screening designs, blocking, fractional factorial designs) since these are the techniques that are the most commonly used by practicing engineers. The students will also be expected to become proficient in the use of statistical software to analyse experimental data.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Cross Disciplinary Programs Office", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 200, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2017 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1230"}, {"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 43200, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 1230"}], "size": 25, "enrolment": 4}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 36000, "duration": 3600, "location": "WB 144"}], "size": 25, "enrolment": 3}]}

Some of the events and processes that we call \"hazardous,\" such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, floods, tsunamis, cyclones, and forest fires are natural environmental processes. We define them as hazards only when they pose a threat to human interests. In this course we will examine natural hazards as well as some technological hazards -- their causes, their potential impacts on people, and their management and mitigation.

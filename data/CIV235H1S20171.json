Drawings are prepared making use of freehand sketching, drafting equipment and commercially available computer drafting programs. Topics in descriptive geometry are covered to develop spatial visualization skills. Drawing procedures and standards relevant to Civil Engineering projects to be covered include layout and development of multiple orthographic views, sectional views, dimensioning, and pictorial views. Class projects, assignments, and examples demonstrate how graphical skills fit into the overall design process.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Civil Engineering", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 200, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2017 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "P0101", "instructors": ["D Gauvreau"], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 43200, "duration": 7200, "location": "MB 400"}, {"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 50400, "duration": 7200, "location": "MB 400"}, {"day": "MONDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 54000, "duration": 7200, "location": "MB 400"}], "size": 66, "enrolment": 62}, {"code": "P0102", "instructors": ["D Gauvreau"], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 50400, "duration": 7200, "location": "MB 400"}, {"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 43200, "duration": 7200, "location": "MB 400"}, {"day": "MONDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 61200, "duration": 7200, "location": "MB 400"}], "size": 66, "enrolment": 55}]}

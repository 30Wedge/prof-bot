{"id": "CIV576H1S20171", "code": "CIV576H1S", "name": "Sustainable Buildings", "description": "Building systems including the thermal envelope, heating and cooling systems, as well as water and lighting systems are examined with a view to reducing the net energy consumed within the building. Life-cycle economic and assessment methods are applied to the evaluation of various design options including considerations of embodied energy and carbon sequestration. Green building strategies including natural ventilation, passive solar, photovoltaics, solar water heaters, green roofs and geothermal energy piles are introduced. Following the application of these methods, students are introduced to efficient designs including LEED designs that lessen the impact of buildings on the environment. Exemplary building designs will be presented and analyzed.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Civil Engineering", "prerequisites": "CIV375H1/CIV575H1 or equivalent.", "exclusions": "", "level": 500, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2017 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "RS 208"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 43200, "duration": 7200, "location": "RS 208"}], "size": 75, "enrolment": 64}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 61200, "duration": 7200, "location": "GB 405"}], "size": 75, "enrolment": 61}]}

{"id": "MSE351H1S20171", "code": "MSE351H1S", "name": "Design and Simulation of Materials Processes", "description": "Various phenomena involved in materials processing and design will be modeled using a software package based on the finite element method. Examples will include aspects of solid state diffusion, structural stress, heat transfer, fluid flow and chemical reactions. The problems will involve unsteady state as well as 3 dimensional systems. Multi-physics phenomena such as heating of an electric component by an electric current, resulting in a change in physical properties affecting thermal properties will also be introduced. The main objective of this course is to introduce students to the use of a commercial software package to solve fairly common but complex physical and chemical phenomena related to the materials industry.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Materials Science and Engineering", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2017 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["C Singh"], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 57600, "duration": 3600, "location": "WB 219"}, {"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 61200, "duration": 7200, "location": "WB 219"}], "size": 60, "enrolment": 59}, {"code": "P0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 39600, "duration": 7200, "location": "GB 144"}], "size": 60, "enrolment": 57}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "WB 342"}], "size": 60, "enrolment": 57}]}

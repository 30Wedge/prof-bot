Which course of action is the right one? When and why should we blame ourselves and/or others? We all have and exercise moral opinions; this course is about justifying them. The course begins with some critical reasoning skills, and then explores three major philosophical strategies for justifying moral beliefs. We will then examine some specific issues of moral and political significance, such as freedom of expression, counter-terrorism, and economic inequality, before concluding with some of the psychological mechanisms behind moral attitudes and behaviour.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Centre for Ethics", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 200, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2016 Fall", "breadths": [2], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["C Mark"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 61200, "duration": 7200, "location": "LA 211"}], "size": 50, "enrolment": 50}]}

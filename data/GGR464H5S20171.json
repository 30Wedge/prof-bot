{"id": "GGR464H5S20171", "code": "GGR464H5S", "name": "Advanced Remote Sensing", "description": "This course builds on the fundamental remote sensing concepts, techniques, and applications introduced in GGR 337, and aims to provide an advanced study of digital image processing and remote sensing applications. Topics include image pre-processing and calibration, spectral data transformation, image enhancement, pattern recognition, artificial intelligence, hyperspectral image analysis, and change detection. Students will apply these advanced remote sensing techniques in practical lab exercises and a term project.

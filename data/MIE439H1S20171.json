Topics include cellular mechanics, blood rheology, circulatory mechanics, respiratory mechanics, skeletal mechanics, and locomotion. Applications of these topics to biomimetic and biomechanical design are emphasized through a major, integrative group project.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Division of Engineering Science", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2017 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "P0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 57600, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 2139"}, {"day": "MONDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 57600, "duration": 7200, "location": "MB 325"}], "size": 75, "enrolment": 45}, {"code": "L0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 54000, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 1240"}, {"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1240"}], "size": 75, "enrolment": 45}]}

It asks what it means to enter modernity under colonial rule, and questions the relationship between imperialism, writing, and subjectivity. Topics include the role of literature in elaborating new concepts of subjectivity, literature and the fine arts as assimilatory practices, the emergence of urban space and reconfiguration of notions of the rural, and changing notions of time and space in the cultural products of nativism. Readings of literary works will be accompanied by showings of paintings and photographs from the period, as well as discussions of theoretical essays on modernism.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "East Asian Studies", "prerequisites": "EAS105H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2016 Fall", "breadths": [1], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["J Poole"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 57600, "duration": 7200, "location": "SS 1070"}], "size": 45, "enrolment": 45}]}

{"id": "CHE390H1F20169", "code": "CHE390H1F", "name": "Physical and Inorganic Chemistry", "description": "The objective of this course is to introduce fundamental chemistry required in order to understand environmental systems. The chemistry of inorganic compounds will be introduced in terms of atomic orbitals, molecular structure, periodic trends and coordination chemistry. The impact of pH, oxidation potential and complexation on chemical speciation will be described and related to chemistry in natural waters. Intermediate level concepts relevant to chemical kinetics such as rate laws and mechanisms will be presented and applied to photochemistry and atmospheric chemistry. Partitioning in multiphase systems will be discussed with emphasis on adsorption and chemistry in water/soil systems.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Division of Engineering Science", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2016 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": []}

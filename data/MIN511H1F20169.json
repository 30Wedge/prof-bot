Engineering case studies will be used throughout, and each case study will be evaluated in terms of how the mine waste systems used contribute to the economic and environmental sustainability of the mining operation.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Civil Engineering", "prerequisites": "CME321H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 500, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2016 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 61200, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 2165"}], "size": 50, "enrolment": 19}, {"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["M Grabinsky"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 61200, "duration": 7200, "location": "RS 310"}, {"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "WB 219"}], "size": 50, "enrolment": 19}]}

In emerging social media space capacity to characterize imagined audiences provides a foundational framework for determining the information representations and presentations necessary to create those virtual audiences. This approach is foundation to personal, commercial and public sector exploration of virtual worlds. Beginning with an exploration of the nature and role of audiences across multiple virtual and electronic media, the students explore the conception, perception and reality of imagined and actual audiences. Broadcast models, interactive models, live audience, audience reading, gender, culture, and audience feedback are investigated.", "division": "University of Toronto Mississauga", "department": "Institute of Communication and Culture", "prerequisites": "CCT213H5, CCT218H5", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTM", "term": "2016 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": []}

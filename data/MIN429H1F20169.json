{"id": "MIN429H1F20169", "code": "MIN429H1F", "name": "Engineering Rock Mechanics", "description": "This course introduces students to the fundamental concepts of rock mechanics and their application to rock engineering. The following rock mechanics topics are covered: stress and strain; in situ stress; intact rock strength; discontinuity geometry, strength and stiffness; rock mass behavious; anisotropy, heterogeneity and the size effect; rock mass classifcation schemes. Rock engineering topics include: rock excavation; rock stabilisation; instability mechanisms in foundationas and slopes; rock slope design methods; underground openings in discontinuous and continuous rocks; rock-support interaction; synopsis of numerical methods.\u00a0 Associated laboratory sessions involve stress measurement, core logging, compressive strength determination and index testing.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Civil Engineering", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "CIV529H1.", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2016 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["J Harrison"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "RS 208"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 43200, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 1240"}], "size": 50, "enrolment": 22}, {"code": "P0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 64800, "duration": 10800, "location": "GB 308"}], "size": 50, "enrolment": 21}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 39600, "duration": 3600, "location": "RS 208"}], "size": 50, "enrolment": 21}]}

This course explores these topics while relating them to literary and cultural contexts as well as students' real life through extensive reading and analysis of ultra contemporary novels and short stories by authors such as Dany Laferri\u00e8re, Ying Chen, Aki Shimazaki, Kim Th\u00fay, Marco Micone, Abla Farhoud, Sergio Kokis, Agota Kristof, Dai Sijie, or Nancy Huston.

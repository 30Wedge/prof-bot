{"id": "NMC476H1S20171", "code": "NMC476H1S", "name": "Politics of Archaeology in the Modern Middle East", "description": "This course examines the role nineteenth and twentieth-century archaeology played in Middle Eastern politics, the culture of colonialism and in nationalist struggles. The course will first familiarize the students with the diplomatic and intellectual context of the formation of archaeology as a field of study in Europe and analyse the role archaeology played in the production of knowledge about the Middle East. Next, the course will examine the archaeological practices on the ground (and underground) and inquire what happens in the contact zone between foreign and local archaeologists. Finally, we will trace the ways in which emergent nationalist discourse challenge, appropriate and imitate the historical narratives of Western archaeology.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Near & Middle Eastern Civilizations", "prerequisites": "Permission of instructor is required.", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2017 Winter", "breadths": [3], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["J Hanssen"], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 46800, "duration": 7200, "location": "BF 214"}], "size": 15, "enrolment": 5}]}

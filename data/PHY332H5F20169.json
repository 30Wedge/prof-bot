{"id": "PHY332H5F20169", "code": "PHY332H5F", "name": "Molecular Biophysics", "description": "A physicist's perspective on the building blocks of the living world, such as nucleic acids, proteins and lipids. The course will cover topics such as symmetry, structural complexity of the biological macromolecules, molecular interactions in the cellular environment and the impact for the biological function. Basic concepts from mechanics and thermodynamics will be applied specifically to proteins and DNA in order to understand structural transitions, stabilizing interactions, reaction dynamics and equilibrium. A rigorous treatment of a wide range of biophysical techniques commonly use in life science, such as optical spectroscopy, light scattering, mass spectrometry and single-molecule methods, will be accompanied by recent examples from the molecular biophysics research.

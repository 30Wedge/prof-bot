The first part of the course will stress basic principles in each of these disciplines. The second portion of the course will integrate these disciplines in the context of specific organ systems. For example, the physiology of the cardiovascular system, the development of the system, cardiovascular disease, the relationship between developmental defects and adult disease, current disease treatment, cardiovascular devices, and the current progress in cardiovascular tissue engineering will be presented. The teaching material will be gathered from various textbooks and scientific journals. Whenever possible, experts in the relevant field will teach guest lectures. This integrative approach will be reflected by a problem-based learning approach to testing and a written report.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Division of Engineering Science", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 500, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2017 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 43200, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 1230"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 43200, "duration": 7200, "location": "RS 412"}], "size": 40, "enrolment": 22}]}

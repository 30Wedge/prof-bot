{"id": "MSE451H1S20171", "code": "MSE451H1S", "name": "Advanced Physical Properties of Structural Nanomaterials", "description": "This course deals with the physical properties of bulk nanostructured materials. Included are mechanical properties (elastic behavior, tensile and compressive strength, creep, wear and fatigue properties) electrical properties (electrical transport phenomena, electrical resistivity) magnetic properties (paramagnetic, diamagnetic, soft and hard ferromagnetic, superparamagnetic and antiferromagnetic properties), thermodynamic properties (interfacial enthalpy, thermal stability, phase transformations, heat capacity). The considerable differences observed for nanocrystalline solids compared to conventional polycrystalline and amorphous solids will be discussed in terms of the microstructural differences for these materials.\r\nThis course is not offered for 2016-17.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Materials Science and Engineering", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2017 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "P0101", "instructors": ["G Hibbard"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 64800, "duration": 7200, "location": "GB 150"}], "size": 45, "enrolment": 7}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": ["G Hibbard"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 2165"}], "size": 45, "enrolment": 6}, {"code": "L0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 39600, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1240"}, {"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 39600, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 1240"}], "size": 45, "enrolment": 7}]}

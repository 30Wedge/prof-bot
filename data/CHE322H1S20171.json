{"id": "CHE322H1S20171", "code": "CHE322H1S", "name": "Process Dynamics and Control", "description": "The major goals of this course are to teach students how to model chemical processes and how to design control strategies for these processes. The first part of the course focuses on the types of interconnections encountered in chemical engineering, namely feedback, parallel and series connections, and their effect on the process dynamics. The second part of the course looks at the design of feedback, feedforward, cascade and multivariable control strategies for these processes and interprets these types of \u201cengineered\u201d interconnections in terms of the effect they have on the performance of the overall system. This course will make extensive use of interactive learning through computer simulation based on the Matlab software package and its associated Simulink block diagram simulation environment.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2017 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "T0103", "instructors": ["W Cluett"], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 50400, "duration": 7200, "location": "GB 150"}], "size": 50, "enrolment": 49}, {"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["W Cluett"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 46800, "duration": 3600, "location": "SF 1101"}, {"day": "MONDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 46800, "duration": 3600, "location": "SF 1101"}, {"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "SF 1101"}], "size": 150, "enrolment": 146}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": ["W Cluett"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 54000, "duration": 7200, "location": "GB 144"}], "size": 50, "enrolment": 47}, {"code": "T0102", "instructors": ["W Cluett"], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 50400, "duration": 7200, "location": "GB 144"}], "size": 50, "enrolment": 50}]}

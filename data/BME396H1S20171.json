{"id": "BME396H1S20171", "code": "BME396H1S", "name": "Biomedical Systems Engineering III: Molecules and Cells", "description": "A quantitative approach to understanding cell and molecular biology. Using engineering tools (especially derived from transport phenomena and chemical kinetics) to model molecular dynamics in living cells and make predictions about cellular behaviour. Specific topics include: receptor-ligand interactions, morphogens, trafficking, signal transduction, cell adhesion and migration, and mechanotransduction. Examples from in vitro tissue culture systems and model organisms in vivo are used.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Division of Engineering Science", "prerequisites": "BME395H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2017 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["R Fernandez-Gonzalez"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 61200, "end": 64800, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 2145"}, {"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 39600, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 1240"}], "size": 40, "enrolment": 23}, {"code": "P0101", "instructors": ["R Fernandez-Gonzalez"], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 57600, "duration": 10800, "location": "MB 325"}], "size": 20, "enrolment": 11}, {"code": "P0102", "instructors": ["R Fernandez-Gonzalez"], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 43200, "duration": 10800, "location": "MB 325"}], "size": 20, "enrolment": 12}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": ["R Fernandez-Gonzalez"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 64800, "end": 68400, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 2145"}], "size": 40, "enrolment": 23}]}

Topics addressed include interpolation, integration, linear systems, least-squares fitting, nonlinear equations and optimization, initial value problems, partial differential equations, and relaxation methods. The assignments make extensive use of MATLAB. Assignments also require knowledge of Fortran or C.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Division of Engineering Science", "prerequisites": "ESC103H1 and MAT185H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2017 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 61200, "duration": 7200, "location": "WB 219"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 57600, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1220"}], "size": 40, "enrolment": 28}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1220"}], "size": 40, "enrolment": 28}]}

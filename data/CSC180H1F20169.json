{"id": "CSC180H1F20169", "code": "CSC180H1F", "name": "Introduction to Computer Programming", "description": "The first of two\u00a0courses that introduces students to programming and computational thinking, and prepares them for additional study across a breadth of programming fields. Students will learn to use the Python programming language to\u00a0design and implement computational solutions to problems drawn from their 1F courses, with specific focus on algorithms, data structures, problem decomposition, and the use of programming paradigms appropriate to the problems being solved. Specifically, this course aims to have students work with and understand profiling and runtime analysis, searching and sorting algorithms, and the use of recursion.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Division of Engineering Science", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "APS105H1, APS106H1 or CSC192H1", "level": 100, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2016 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["M Guerzhoy"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 61200, "end": 64800, "duration": 3600, "location": "SF 1101"}, {"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1130"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 57600, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1130"}], "size": 160, "enrolment": 124}, {"code": "L0102", "instructors": ["M Guerzhoy"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 61200, "duration": 3600, "location": "MB 128"}, {"day": "MONDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 61200, "duration": 3600, "location": "SF 1101"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "WB 116"}], "size": 190, "enrolment": 125}, {"code": "P0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 43200, "duration": 10800, "location": "SF 1013"}], "size": 135, "enrolment": 82}, {"code": "P0102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 43200, "duration": 10800, "location": "SF 1013"}], "size": 115, "enrolment": 87}, {"code": "P0103", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 64800, "duration": 10800, "location": "SF 1013"}], "size": 105, "enrolment": 80}]}

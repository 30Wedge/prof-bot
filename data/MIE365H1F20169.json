Linear programming extensions are presented: goal programming, column generation, Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition, and interior point solution methods.\u00a0 Non-linear programming solution methods are developed: optimality conditions, quadratic programming and bi-level programming. Solutions to advanced stochastic models: stochastic programming, 2-person and n-person game theory, and Markov Decision Processes.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Mechanical & Industrial Engineering", "prerequisites": "MIE262H1, MIE263H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2016 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 36000, "duration": 3600, "location": "GB 405"}], "size": 80, "enrolment": 71}, {"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["D Frances"], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 43200, "duration": 7200, "location": "WB 130"}, {"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 36000, "duration": 3600, "location": "WB 130"}], "size": 80, "enrolment": 72}, {"code": "P0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 61200, "duration": 7200, "location": "GB 144"}], "size": 40, "enrolment": 40}, {"code": "P0102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 61200, "duration": 7200, "location": "RS 303"}], "size": 40, "enrolment": 31}]}

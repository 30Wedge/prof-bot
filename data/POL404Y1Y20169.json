The seminar examines how these terms are conceptualized and how they affect the practice of liberal democracy, especially in Canada and the U.S. We will spend the first term developing a conceptual toolkit that will help us understand some of the ways in which public and private are conventionally understood. In the second term we will explore some of the new (and often unexpected) ways in which public and private are playing out these days in public policy \u2013 for instance, in education, health, welfare, multiculturalism, professional sports, and war-making.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Political Science", "prerequisites": "2.0 POL credits", "exclusions": "POL410Y1 (2014-15)", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2016 Fall", "breadths": [3], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["R Vipond"], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 43200, "duration": 7200, "location": "UC 255"}], "size": 15, "enrolment": 15}]}
